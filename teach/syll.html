<p><strong>Description of Graded Assessments</strong></p>
<p><strong>OER presentation - lead:</strong> An oral presentation to the
class providing an overview of the topic area including some materials
that will be included in the OER project, identification of key papers,
and selection of recent paper, overview of R resources for the topic,
bibliography). Format is a 50 min lecture appropriate to a
4<sup>th</sup> year undergraduate or 1<sup>st</sup> graduate course,
followed by a paper discussion, and ideas for the class contribution to
the OER product</p>
<p><strong>OER presentation - supporting:</strong> An oral presentation
to the class providing an overview of the topic area including some
materials that will be included in the OER project, identification of
key papers, and selection of recent paper, overview of R resources for
the topic, bibliography). Format is a 20 min lecture appropriate to a
4<sup>th</sup> year undergraduate or 1<sup>st</sup> graduate course,
followed by a paper discussion, and ideas for the class contribution to
the OER product</p>
<p><strong>OER outline - lead:</strong> Each student will submit a
written outline of the OER presentation that can be incorporated in the
course OER materials (.md or .rmd format). This material will cover
major concepts in the area (~2 pages), a classical reading (~1 page),
and a new reading (~1page), R resources and a bibliography. References
must be supplied as required, and the document must compile without
errors. Maximum of 2 pages in .pdf format (500 words) due 17:00, 1 weeks
after the initial presentation.</p>
<p><strong>OER materials - lead:</strong> Each student will combine
supporting and original materials in a teaching unit (.md or .rmd
format). This material will cover major concepts in the area (~2 pages),
a classical reading and a new reading, R resources and a bibliography.
References must be supplied as required, and the document must compile
without errors. Maximum of 5 pages in .pdf format (1500 words) due
17:00, 2 weeks after the initial presentation. Final grade for this
section will be related to the quality of all submitted materials
(including those created by the supporting team), but the lead will have
the opportunity to both provide feedback to supporting members, and to
revise the materials themselves in accordance with instructor
feedback.</p>
<p><strong>OER materials - supporting:</strong> Each student will submit
written materials for each of the 3 remaining OER sections as requested
by the project lead (.md or .rmd format). This material may cover major
concepts in the area, readings, mathematics or programming, and R
resources. References must be supplied as required, and document must
compile without errors. Should be about 2 pages in .pdf format due
17:00, 2 weeks after the initial presentation. Supporting members will
have the opportunity to revise the materials based on feedback from the
lead and instructor.</p>
<p><strong>Quantitative exercises:</strong> Exercises will graded on a
pass/fail basis with opportunity for revision. Exercises may
include<strong>:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Short answer questions asking students to identify and clearly
explain concepts and theories in ecology</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A satisfactory score is achieved if: 1. All calculations are
correct, 2. All statistics are interpreted correctly, 3. All short
answers are grammatically correct, 4. All answers are broadly correct
(specific details may be wrong, but broad/important concepts must be
right)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>A demonstration of the studentsâ ability to formulate and analyze
statistical and mathematical models</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A satisfactory score is achieved if: 1. All calculations are
correct, 2. All statistics are interpreted correctly, 3. All methods
correctly implemented, and 4. the analysis of mathematical models is
correctly interpreted.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>A demonstration of the studentâs ability to use the R programming
environment to prepare data sets, test hypotheses, construct and analyze
mathematical models, compare model predictions to data, and document
their activities so that the research is reproducible</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A satisfactory score is achieved if: 1. The code runs, 2. The
coding is reproducible, 3. All calculations are correct, 4. All
statistics and models are interpreted correctly</em></p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>For level 4 only, part marks will be used rather than
pass/fail.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Illness</strong></p>
<p>Since the course is structured so that students assess and comment on
the work of others, illness that prevents on time presentations or
delivery of is particularly disruptive. If you believe illness will
prevent you from completing your duties, please inform the instructor AS
SOON AS POSSIBLE in order for us to make alternate arrangements. Illness
that prevents completing of assignments or presentations must be
documented with a verification of illness form from the university
medical center indicating SEVERE incapacitation on the day of the
presentation or the day before an assignment is due.</p>
<p>If for any reason a student misses a presentation, <strong><u>the
weight of the presentation will be added to the materials submission for
the level</u></strong>. If for any reason a student misses the deadline
for materials, a new due date will be assigned, and all students
affected will have related their due dates adjusted. If for any reason a
student misses a submission of a quantitative exercise, the
<strong><u>the weight of that exercise will be automatically added to to
the next exercise</u></strong>. Since the course is structured so that
students assess and comment on the work of others, it will often be
necessary</p>
<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong></p>
<p>In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the
University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust,
fairness, respect and responsibility.</p>
<p>Students are expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, to
avoid committing academic offenses, and to take responsibility for their
actions. Students who are unsure whether an action constitutes an
offense, or who need help in learning how to avoid offenses (e.g.,
plagiarism, cheating) or about ârulesâ for group work/collaboration
should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or
the Associate Dean of Science for Undergraduate Studies. For information
on categories of offenses and types of penalties, students should refer
to Policy #71, Student Discipline. For information on typical penalties,
students should check Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties.</p>
<p>If you need help in learning what constitutes an academic offence;
how to avoid offences such as plagiarism, cheating, and unauthorized
resubmission of work; how to follow appropriate rules with respect to
âgroup workâ and collaboration; or if you need clarification of aspects
of the discipline policy, ask your course instructor for guidance. Other
resources regarding the discipline policy are your academic advisor and
the Undergraduate Associate Dean.</p>
<p>Excessive co-operation or collaboration in this course includes but
is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Copying assessment material from another student and
presenting it as your own work</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Re-creating assignments questions and answers without the express
permission of the course instructor</p></li>
<li><p>Obtaining, distributing or receiving unauthorized academic
material without the express consent of the course instructor</p></li>
<li><p>Sharing unauthorized course-related materials via hard-copy,
email, social media or LEARN</p></li>
<li><p>Using LEARN email lists to sell or distribute unauthorized
academic material.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Please note I recommend a grade of 0% (F) when I have
evidence of academic dishonesty.</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
Student grievances and appeals</strong></p>
<p>Students, who believe that a decision affecting some aspect of their
university life has been unfair or unreasonable, may have grounds for
initiating a grievance. Students should read Policy #70, Student
Petitions and Grievances, Section 4. When in doubt, students must
contact the departmentâs/schoolâs administrative assistant who will
provide further assistance.</p>
<p>A decision or penalty imposed under <a
href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-33-procedures-resolving-complaints-ethical-misconduct">Policy
33 (Ethical Behavior),</a> <a
href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy
#70 (Student Petitions and Grievances)</a> or <a
href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy
#71 (Student Discipline)</a> may be appealed, if there is a ground.
Students who believe they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a
href="file:///Users/Kim/kim/teach/Policy%20#72%20(Student%20Appeals)">Policy
#72 (Student Appeals)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Student accommodation</strong></p>
<p>If students require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of
their disability, they should register with <a
href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility
Services</a> at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
