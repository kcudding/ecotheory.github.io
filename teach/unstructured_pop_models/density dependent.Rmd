# **Module 1: Unstructured Population Models**

## Density-dependency

Density-dependent population models are used to describe population dynamics in which the growth or decline of a population is influenced by the population's own density.

### Continuous logistic growth

A population growth model may be defined as continuous population growth model if the individuals of a population show continuous breeding season. 

####  Negative density dependence

* The previously discussed scenario where population growth is unregulated does not always happen in reality. In fact, in a population that is already established, resources begin to become scarce, and competition starts to play a role. As a result, the population growth will become an S-shaped curve. This is called **negative density dependence**.

(*Insert a drawn logistic plot*)


* Increasing population size gives rise to:

  + shortages in food or other limiting resources

  + greater intraspecific aggression

  + increased predation risks
  
  + greater risks of disease outbreak

<!-- insert a intrinsic per captia growth rate figure here,
from https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/how-populations-grow-the-exponential-and-logistic-13240157/ -->

* Negative density dependence decreases population growth at high density and increases it at low density.


##### "K": carrying capacity

* **Ecological interpretation**: Maximum number of individuals an area can support

* **Mathematical interpretation**: Population density at which per capital growth rate is zero

* **Note**: Do not think of carrying capacity as the maximum population size observed. A population can exceed K temporarily.

(*insert the duckweed example on carrying capacity*)

##### Logistic growth model

We can mathematically model logistic growth by slightly modifying our equation for exponential growth:

$$ dN/dt=r \frac{K-N}{K} N $$

* $dN/dt$: The net number of new individuals in a population over a unit of time (also called recruitment or yield)

* $r$: Intrinsic growth rate

* $N$: Population size

* $K$: Carrying capacity

* $K-N$: How many more individuals can be added to the population before it hits carrying capacity

* $K-N/K$: The fraction of the carrying capacity that has not yet been â€œused up"

<br/>
The population growth rate maximizes when $N = K/2$

### Discrete logistic growth

For many populations, reproduction and mortality occur at very particular periods of the year (in discrete intervals of time).

#### Discrete logistic equation

To accurately predict the population change overtime, we need to use the discrete logistic model.

Discrete logistic models describe how a population changes over discrete time intervals:

$$ N(t+1) = N(t)(1+r(1-\frac{N(t)}{K})) $$

* From the equation, we can see that the population abundance at time $t+1$ depend on the abundance at time t. This time lag makes sense for many populations, where birth and death rates respond to the population's density at some time in the past, instead of current density.


#### Chaos (if this section needs more details)

Populations growing with absolutely no stochasticity could show dynamics that bounce, or cycle, or become entirely unpredictable.

Mathematical interpretation: Aperiodic fluctuations arising from a deterministic model.

(*insert graph of the chaos, and explanations of the graph*)

* Chaotic dynamics are **highly sensitive to initial conditions**. 

* Note that chaos is different from stochasticity or randomness. If you start with exactly the same initial conditions under chaotic dynamics, you will get exactly the same population trajectories every time.

### Comparing continuous and discrete logistic growth

Positive or negative effects resulting from a given population are felt by the next generation (time-lag in comparison with continuous models, which are based in very small time steps and simultaneous demographic events)

### Other types of density denpendent population models

The linear decline in per-capital growth rate with density modeled above is not necessarily general.

#### Concave and convex density dependences

* In fact, most species exhibit **nonlinear** declines in growth rate under negative density dependence.


* **Concave density dependence**: Per-capita population growth rate declines rapidly at low density, and then falttens out as carrying capacity is approached.

* **Convex density dependence**: Per-capita population growth rate exhibit strong density dependence only near K.

#### Theta-Ricker model

A varity of alternative equations exist to model concave or convex relationships. A simple model we introduce here is the Theta-Ricker model:

$$ N_{t+1} = N_t e^{r_0[1-(N_t/K)^\theta]} $$

* Term Theta $\theta$ is added to control the shape of the decrement in the pre-capita growth rate with density

* $\theta > 1$ is concave, $\theta < 1$ is convex (shown by the below example)

(*example*)

#### Positive density dependence

In many cases, cooperation or facilitation leads to mutually positive interactions among members of a population.

**Positive density dependence** occurs when vital rates or population increase as density increases.

##### Allee effect

Allee initially noticed that goldfish grew faster in water which had previously contained other goldfish, than in water that had not. He further experimented with a number of different species and showed that larger group size or some degree of crowding may stimulate reproduction,prolong survival in adverse conditions (through resistance to desiccation or by social thermoregulation) and enhance protection from toxic reagents. (Allee, 1931)


**Allee effect**:

*  Demonstrates that there is a positive correlation between population density and individual fitness.

* Occurs at very low population sizes (growth rate is reduced when population is too small).

Example: 

* African wild dog usually live in a pack of 6 - 20 individuals

* Increasing pack size can:

  + increase the likelihood of a successful kill in a given hunt
  
  + better predator defense
  
  + help babysit pups (packs with 10 or more adults raised three times as many yearlings compared to packs with 9 or fewer adults)
  

To plot per capita growth rate as a function of abundance:

$$ dN/dt = rN(\frac{N}{M}-1)(1-\frac{N}{K})$$

(*include calculations example of allee effect*)


##### Weak and strong Allee effects

* **Weak Allee effects**: A weak Allee effect is where the population growth rate is small but positive for small N. The population does not contain a critical population size or density under which the growth rate becomes negative. 

* **Strong Allee effects**: A strong Allee effect describes a population that can grow at intermediate population densities but declines when the number of organisms is either too small or too large.

* **Allee effect population threshold**: A population size below which the per capita growth rate is negative and the population declines towards extinction.

Populations that are subject to Allee effects can collapse and become extinct if their population size falls below the critical threshold.

### Paper Discussion: 


![](https://raw.github.com/kcudding/kcudding.github.io/main/teach/unstructured_pop_models/paper_discuss.png)

#### Snapshot of the study

* Density dependence is a key consideration in the theory of harvest management.

* This paper provides an overview of density dependence on ungulates and upland game birds, and relates back to wildlife management.

* Different aspects of wildlife management:

  + Harvesting: If the logistic curve gives satisfactory performance, wildlife managers can estimate through logistic modeling the population level that maximizes or optimizes **sustained yield**.
  
  + Survival and reproduction: To maintain a sustainable population, wildlife managers have to carefully balance survival and reproduction. (calculation shown below)
  
* Why is empirical application of density-dependent theory lacking?

  + Estimation of parameters (K,r) requires a long-term data set on a growing population. Such data are often lacking
  
  + At large scales (eg. states), wildlife managers have little or no motivation to harvest under logistic theory. They care more about maximizing recreational opportunity.
  
  + Populations may, at some times, behave in density-dependent ways and at others exhibit density-independence. Environmental influences may add more complexity.


#### Example Calculation: The dilemma of *survival* and *production*

Consider a simple difference equation that applies to a species with simple dynamics:

$$ N_{t+1} = S_tN_t(1+R_t)$$
where $N_t$, number of animals in the population in year $t$; $S_t$, probability of survival in year $t$, and $R_t$, relative production (juveniles/adult) in year $t$.


Now we define a population growth multiplier ($\lambda_t$):

$$\lambda_t = \frac{N_{t+1}}{N_t} = S_t(1+R_t)$$

```{r}
# Suppose management in a sustaining quail population increases the annual survival rate from 0.20 to 0.25 in a population with relative production of 4 juveniles/adult.
St <- 0.25
Rt <- 4

# Now we can calculate the value of lambda:
lambda <- St*(1+Rt)
lambda
```

The resulting growth multiplier is **not sustainable** because it exceeds 1.0 (i.e., with $\lambda = 1.25$, the population increases geometrically).

```{r}
# To obtain a sustainable population that has an annual survival rate of 0.25, we need to recalculate the relative production rate:
St <- 0.25
lambda <- 1
Rt <- lambda/St - 1
Rt
```

For the population to be sustainable at an annual survival rate of 0.25, relative production must decrease to 3 juveniles/adult.


#### Key discussion items from this paper

* Implication on wildlife management strategies.

* Allow state wildlife agencies to set better hunting regulations.

* Sportsmen often do not under-stand that higher yields occur at lower population densities.
