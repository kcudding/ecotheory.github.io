## Key Papers for Further Reading

### Classical reading

These three papers provide mathematics/theories of IPM:

- Easterling, M.R., Ellner, S.P. and Dixon, P.M. (2000), Size-specific sensitivity: applying a new structured population model. _Ecology_, 81: 694-708.
- Ellner, S.P. and Rees, M. (2006), Integral projection models for species with complex demography. _Am Nat._, 167(3):410-28.
- Ellner, S.P. and Rees, M. (2007), Stochastic stable population growth in integral projection models: theory and application. _J. Math. Biol._, 54: 227–256

The following two papers provide useful practical guide:

- Rees, M., Childs, D.Z. and Ellner, S.P. (2014), Building integral projection models: a user's guide. _J Anim Ecol_, 83: 528-545.
- Merow, C., Dahlgren, J.P., Metcalf, C.J.E., Childs, D.Z., Evans, M.E.K., Jongejans, E., Record, S., Rees, M., Salguero-Gómez, R. and McMahon, S.M. (2014), Advancing population ecology with integral projection models: a practical guide. _Methods Ecol Evol_, 5: 99-110.

The following book provides a thorough introduction about IPM. The practical parts are summarized in Rees et al. (2014)

### New reading

Here are some recent applications of IPM

- Erickson, R.A., Eager, E.A., Kocovsky, P.M., Glover, D.C., Kallis, J.L. and Long, K.R. (2018), A spatially discrete, integral projection model and its application to invasive carp. _Ecological Modelling_, 387:163-171.
- Peirce, J., Sandland, G., Bennie, B. and Erickson, R. (2023), An integral projection model for gizzard shad (_Dorosoma cepedianum_) utilizing density-dependent age-0 survival. _Ecological Modelling_, 477:110260.

## R resources

- _IPMpack_ (Metcalf et al., 2013)
- ipmr (Levin et al., 2021)
- lefko3 (Shefferson et al., 2021) (This package is devoted to the analysis of demographic data through MPM. It also builds discretized IPM)
