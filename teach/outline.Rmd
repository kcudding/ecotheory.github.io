## Introduction to population structure

So far, we have limited our prediction of wild populations by assuming that all individuals in a population are identical. However, many plants and animals have demonstrated distinct age or stage structure in their populations. In fact, ecologists care about these particular parts of a population as much as they do the population as a whole. To truly understand and predict population growth, we cannot avoid discussing the dynamics of these particular ages and stages.

### Age and stage structure

In the same population, individuals can have markedly different dynamics depending on their age.

* Coulson et al. (2001) found that individual susceptibility to changing environmental conditions differs between Soay sheep of different ages. Young and old individuals are more severely affected by adverse weather conditions than adults of prime reproductive age.

* insert images of soay sheep


While for many species, differences in vital rates in wild populations often depend on developmental or morphological stages, rather than ages.

* provide the common frog example


### Life tables

A **life table** is a record of survival and reproductive rates in a population, broken out by age, size, or developmental stage.

* insert the example from mountain sheep


### Life history stage diagram

We can use a life stage diagram to represent the dynamics in a population.

* Consider the following example for common frog: 

* This diagram can be converted to a population matrix.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Plot the matrix:
library(DiagrammeR)

grViz("digraph {

graph[layout = dot, rankdir = LR]

Prejuvenile
Juvenile
Adult

Prejuvenile -> Juvenile [label = '0.019']
Juvenile -> Adult [label = '0.08']

Adult -> Prejuvenile [label = '279.50', style = dashed]
Juvenile -> Prejuvenile [label = '52.00', style = dashed]

Adult -> Adult [label = '0.43']
Juvenile -> Juvenile [label = '0.25']

}")
```


### Use matrix to represent population dynamics

Compared to life tables and life history diagrams, population matrices are more versatile and practical tools for presenting how structure affects wildlife population dynamics.

A handy way to decipher the biological meaning of any matrix element is to label the rows and columns of the matrix with the consecutive stages of the target organism. Each element gives the transition from the current column number to the current row number.

* For example, $a_{i,j}$ represents the number of individuals contributed on average by each individual in class j this year to class i next year.

Consider the following matrix, common frog has three stages, pre-juvenile, juvenile, and adult. The time step is 1 year.

* The first row ($a_{1,2} = 52, a_{1,3} = 279.5$) represents reproduction from each stage to the next year.

* The diagonal ($a_{2,2} = 0.25, a_{3,3} = 0.43$) represents the proportion of individuals in a stage that will survive and still be in the same stage next year.

* The sub-diagonal ($a_{2,1} = 0.019, a_{3,2} = 0.08$) represents the proportion surviving and advancing to the next stage.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Create a matrix
X <- matrix(0, nrow=3, ncol=3,
            dimnames = list(c("Pre-juvenile","Juvenile","Adult"),
                            c("Pre-juvenile","Juvenile","Adult")))
X[2,1] <- 0.019
X[2,2] <- 0.25
X[1,2] <- 52
X[1,3] <- 279.5
X[3,2] <- 0.08
X[3,3] <- 0.43

## Structured population models

### Project the matrix

Once the matrix model is filled with vital rates it can be projected through time, keeping track of both total population size and numbers of individuals in each stage.

To determine the population size vector next year $n(t+1)$, multiply the matrix $M$ of vital rates by the vector of individuals at current time $n(t)$:

$$n(t+1) = M*n(t)$$


### Stable age distribution (SSD)

Any wildlife population with a particular set of constant vital rates can achieve a certain distribution of individuals across stages (SSD).

* Demonstrate using a matrix population calculation example


### Transient dynamics

A population with a stage distribution different from that expected at SSD will experience **transient dynamics** until it settles down to the asymptotic growth rate at SSD.


### Population inertia

#### Population momentum
(read Koons et al., 2007)

#### Reproductive value


## Sensitivities and Elasticities

### Sensitivity

**Analytical sensitivity** can be defined as the tiny absolute change in $\lambda$ caused by a tiny absolute change in a vital rate, while all other rates are held constant.

### Elasticity

**Elasticity** are proportional sensitivity that describe tiny proportional change in $\lambda$ with a tiny proportional change in a vital rate.

Elasticity of matrix element $a_{i,j}$ = (sensitivity of $a_{i,j}$)$\frac{a_{i,j}}{\lambda}$

### Component sensitivity and elasticity


## Stochasticity in age and stage-structured populations

(use examples to illustrate)

### Environmental stochasticity
### Demographic stochasiticity

### Classical paper of the topic

#### Knowledge gaps

* The soay sheep population on the island of Hirta (northwest of Scotland) fluctuates dramatically, and previous researches were unable to distinguish the interactions between density dependence, unexplained variation, and demography.

* **Objective**: Develop a more complex population model with more data. Explore age- and sex-specific associations between survival, density, and weather.

#### Methods

* Use a mark-recapture-recovery analysis from field-collected individual data between 1986 and 1996.

#### Discussion

* Simulated populations of the same initial size, under the same weather conditions, but with different age and sex structure, can have different population trajectories.

  + The more lambs and older females (the survival of which are more strongly related to weather and density-dependence) in the population, the more likely the population is to decline from high densities.

* Generally good climate conditions allow the population to increase; a bad weather interacts with density and demography to produce a crash.

  + When the weather becomes wetter and stormier, the mean population size declines.

  + The importance of environmental variation, especially with global climate change.

* The necessity to incorporate age and sex into accurately predict population dynamics.


### Latest paper of the topic

#### Knowledge gaps

* Burbot were illegally introduced into the Green River basin during the 1990s, and they pose a threat to native fishes by direct predation.

* Data on nonnative Burbot population structure and dynamics are needed before initiating a suppression program.

* The difference between lotic (slow-growing) and lentic (fast-growing) populations of Burbot remains unclear.

* **Objective:** Describe the population characteristics of Burbot, as well as any differences that exit between the lotic and lentic populations. Estimate the appropriate exploitation goals that would be needed to suppress the Burbot population below replacement level.

#### Methods

* Field-collected Burbot fish samples. Obtained and calculated vital rates.

* A female-based Leslie matrix.
![Brauer et al., 2018](images/matrix.png)

#### Discussions:

* From the age-structured population model, lentic Burbot mature earlier, grow faster, and have lower mortality. The population will increase at an annual rate of 23% in the absence of exploitation.

* Model limitation: did not consider the movement of Burbot between lentic and lotic environments.

* The age-structured population model showed fast population growth for Bubort in this reservoir ($\lambda$ = 1.18).

* Removal of age-1 or age-2 fish would be the most effective. However, current fishing techniques can only effectively target age-3 and older individuals. Therefore, exploitation would need to exceed 33% annually to effectively suppress Burbot in the study reservoirs.
