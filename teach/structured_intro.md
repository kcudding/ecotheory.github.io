## Introduction to population structure

So far, we have limited our prediction of wild populations by assuming that all individuals in a population are identical. However, many plants and animals have distinct age or stage structure in their populations. In fact, ecologists care about these particular parts of a population as much as they do the population as a whole. To understand and predict population growth, we cannot avoid discussing the dynamics of these particular ages and stages.

### Different population structures

In the same population, individuals can have markedly different dynamics depending on their age. This is called **age structure**. For example, Coulson et al. (2001) found that individual susceptibility to changing environmental conditions differs between Soay sheep of different ages. Young and old individuals are more severely affected by adverse weather conditions than adults of prime reproductive age.

While for many species (especially for amphibians, fish, and insects), differences in vital rates in wild populations often depend on developmental or morphological stages, rather than ages. This is referred to as **stage structure**. For example, common frogs can be divided into three stages according to their developmental status: Pre-juvenile, juvenile, and adults. The vital rates within each stage are relatively constant. (Biek et al., 2002)

**Size structure** is another commonly used category. For many fish species, age and body size (fork length) is highly correlated. Since fish length is much easier to measure and obtain, it is common to categorize fish into different size groups when building a population matrix.


### Life tables

A **life table** is a record of survival and reproductive rates in a population, broken out by age, size, or developmental stage.

Consider the same common frog example we discussed above:

* Common frogs can be divided into three stages according to their developmental status: Pre-juvenile, juvenile, and adults. We can record the demographic vital rates and transition probabilities (the probability of surviving and successfully transitioning to the next developmental stage) for each stage in a table:



Table: Demographic vital rates and transition probabilities for different common frog developmental stages (data from Biek et al., 2002)

|Stages       | Survival | Transition | Reproduction |
|:------------|:--------:|:----------:|:------------:|
|Pre-juvenile |    0     |   0.019    |      0       |
|Juvenile     |   0.25   |    0.08    |      52      |
|Adult        |   0.43   |     0      |    279.5     |


#### Methods to construct life tables:

**Cohort-based approach**

The cohort analysis follows all individuals born during a time period, determining the ages that they die and their birth rates as they age. Life tables constructed from the cohort-based method are often called **horizontal or cohort life tables**. Cohort life tables are constructed by tracking the mortality age and birth rate of each individual in a population as they age, until the last one of them dies. It allows researchers to observe the changes in the survival and mortality rates of a population over time. However, it is usually very challenging to follow a cohort from birth to death of the last individual.

**Segment-based approach**

The segment-based approach looks at the births and deaths of all the individuals in the population during some slice of time. Life tables constructed from the segment-based method are often called **vertical or period life tables**. It is often used when studying populations of animals that are difficult to track over time. One example of the segment-based approach is to count tree rings to estimate the age of trees.

In summary, both are useful tools to study population dynamics. Period life tables provide an accurate representation of a population's mortality rate and survivorship at a specific point in time; while cohort life tables provide a more detailed understanding of how a population's mortality rate and survivorship change over time.

### Life history stage diagram

From the life table in the previous section, we can create a life history diagram to represent the vital rates in different population stages.

* In a life history diagram, different stages are represented by different circles, Self-pointing arrows refer to the probability of remaining in the current stage (survival); forward-points arrows refer to the probability of transitioning to the next stage (transition); backward-pointing arrows refer to the fecundity value (reproduction).

![Life history stage diagram showing the vital rates of common frog in three different developmental stages (data from Biek et al., 2002). Red dashed lines represent the reproduction process; solid black lines represent the transition process. The red and black texts represent the fecundity rate or transition probability for the corresponding process. ](images/frog_diagram.jpeg){width=80%}

### Population census

Population census can take place before or after the reproduction event.

**Pre-reproductive census**: Census takes place before reproduction. The young of the year have not yet been born, and the young from last year which survived have reached 1 year-old.

![](pre-repro.jpg){width=70%}

**Post-reproductive census**: Census takes place after reproduction. The population contains both the adults survived from the previous year and the new-born.

![](post-repro.jpg){width=70%}

Biologists generally base their choice of method on which formulation more conveniently suits the life history of the organism and the timing of the data collection.

* For example, someone studying polar bears would have trouble counting the number of young produced, since births takes place in ice caves away from view. Therefore, population census would take place later in the year when the adults emerge with their young. At that time, an observer can see how many cubs have survived but not necessarily how many were born (pre-reproduction census).

* On the other hand, someone studying seabirds typically finds an island where they breed. In this case, population census would take place after reproduction so that the research can count all the newborns sitting side by side with their mothers to estimate the birth rates (post-reproduction census).

Different census methods lead to different fecundity term $F_x$ for age $x$ in the matrix:

* Pre-breeding census: $F_x = s_0b_x$

* Post-breeding census: $F_x = s_xb_{x+1}$

, where $s_x$ is the age-specific survial rate, and $b_x$ is the age-specific birth rate.


### Use matrix to represent population dynamics

Compared to life tables and life history diagrams, population matrices are more versatile and practical tools for presenting how structure affects wildlife population dynamics.

A handy way to decipher the biological meaning of any matrix element is to label the rows and columns of the matrix with the consecutive stages of the target organism. Each element gives the transition from the current column number to the current row number.

* For example, $a_{i,j}$ represents the number of individuals contributed on average by each individual in class j this year to class i next year.

Consider the following matrix, common frog has three stages, pre-juvenile, juvenile, and adult. The time step is 1 year.

* The first row ($a_{1,2} = 52, a_{1,3} = 279.5$) represents reproduction from each stage to the next year.

* The diagonal ($a_{2,2} = 0.25, a_{3,3} = 0.43$) represents the proportion of individuals in a stage that will survive and still be in the same stage next year.

* The sub-diagonal ($a_{2,1} = 0.019, a_{3,2} = 0.08$) represents the proportion surviving and advancing to the next stage.

#### Leslie Matrix - for age structure

* The Leslie Matrix is a discrete, age-structured model of population growth. In a Leslie model, the population is divided into groups based on age classes. The (i,j)th cell in the matrix indicates how many individuals will be in the age class i at the next time step for each individual in stage j. (Leslie, 1945; Leslie, 1948)

* In a Leslie Matrix, an individual can only survive and transition to the next stage, or die, so everything below the first row and not on the subdiagonal of the matrix must be zero.


\begin{bmatrix}
f_0 & f_1 & f_2 & \cdots & f_{m-1}& f_{m} \\
s_0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
0 & s_1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & s_2 & \cdots & 0 & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & s_{m-1} & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}

A leslie matrix consists of $m+1$ rows and $m+1$ columns. $f$ represents the reproductive rate of that age class in the population, $s$ represents the probability for surviving and transitioning to the next age class.

#### Lefkovitch Matrix - for stage/size structure

* The use of Lefkovitch matrix is usually associated with stage structure (or size structure), rather than age structure. (Lefkovitch, 1965)

* Unlike age-structured population models, animals can remain in some stages or size groups for multiple time steps. Therefore, a Lefkovitch matrix appears to be a more accurate representation of these population models.


## Projecting a population matrix through time

### How to project a matrix

Once the matrix model is filled with vital rates it can be projected through time, keeping track of both total population size and numbers of individuals in each stage.

To determine the population size vector next year $\mathbf{n}(t+1)$, multiply the matrix $\mathbf{M}$ of vital rates by the vector of individuals at current time $\mathbf{n}(t)$:

$$\mathbf{n}(t+1) = \mathbf{M}\mathbf{n}(t)$$

Projecting the matrix through time requires you to understand the fundemantals of matrix math. If you are unfamiliar with how to conduct matrix multlipcation, please check out [this tutorial](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/x9e81a4f98389efdf:matrices/x9e81a4f98389efdf:multiplying-matrices-by-matrices/a/multiplying-matrices).


**Example:**

Consider the population model of common frog we have been discussing. The population can be divided into three developmental stages, and the vital rates are reported in the matrix in the previous section. In 2010, the population consists of **70 pre-juveniles, 20 juveniles, and 10 adults** (initial population), what is the population number for each stage in 2011 (one time step later)?

By multiplying the number of frogs times the matrix of mean vital rates, we project the population forward for a year.

* The matrix $\times$ Population vector in 2010 = Population vector in 2011



$$
\begin{bmatrix}0&52&279.5 \\0.019&0.25&0 \\0&0.08&0.43 \\\end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix}70 \\20 \\10 \\\end{bmatrix} = 
 \begin{bmatrix}
  (0 \times 70) + (52 \times 50) + (279.5 \times 10) \\
  (0.019 \times 70) + (0.25 \times 50) + (0 \times 10)  \\
  (0 \times 70) + (0.08 \times 50) + (0.43 \times 10) \\
 \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}3835 \\6 \\6 \\\end{bmatrix}
$$


### Stable age/stage distribution

A property of a stage structured population is that, if all the vital rates in the projection matrix remain constant, the population stage structure will approach a stable stage distribution, in which the relative number of individuals in each stage, and the population growth rate $\lambda$ will be constant.

Consider the same common frog example. We have an initial population of 70 pre-juveniles, 20 juveniles, and 10 adults in 2010. With constant vital rates, we project the population for 14 years:


```r
years <- 14
# Create an empty matrix to store the population projection results
N.project <- matrix(0, nrow = 3, ncol = years+1)
# Add the initial population for each stage
N.project[,1] <- c(70,20,10)

# Use a for loop to iterate through the time steps
for (i in 1:years) {
  N.project[, i+1] <- X %*% N.project[,i]
}
```
With the population abundance in each stage, we can calculate the stage distribution 14 years later (2023):

```r
# Calculate the stage distribution for 2023
s.2023 <- sum(N.project[,14])
# Pre-juvenile:
N.project[1,14]/s.2023
```

```
[1] 0.9813586
```

```r
# Juvenile:
N.project[2,14]/s.2023
```

```
[1] 0.01713166
```

```r
# Adult:
N.project[3,14]/s.2023
```

```
[1] 0.001509782
```

Similarly, we can calculate the stage distribution 15 years later (2024):

```r
# Calculate the stage distribution for 2024
s.2024 <- sum(N.project[,15])
# Pre-juvenile:
N.project[1,15]/s.2024
```

```
[1] 0.9813508
```

```r
# Juvenile:
N.project[2,15]/s.2024
```

```
[1] 0.0171394
```

```r
# Adult:
N.project[3,15]/s.2024
```

```
[1] 0.001509771
```

We can see that the relative proportion of individuals in each stage class stays the same. The stage structure at SSD is:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
98.1\% \\
1.7\%\\
0.2\% \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
This result can also be demonstrated by plotting the log number of individuals in each stage class versus time:
![Population numbers of common frog over 14 years as shown by stage class. The number of frogs is plotted on a logarithmic scale](SSDplot-1.jpeg)

At SSD, the population growth rate $\lambda$ also stays constant. See the calculations below for $\lambda$ at year 14 and 15:


```r
# The population growth rate from year 2022-2023 is:
sum(N.project[,14])/sum(N.project[,13])
```

```
[1] 1.338596
```

```r
# The population growth rate from year 2023-2024 is:
sum(N.project[,15])/sum(N.project[,14])
```

```
[1] 1.337779
```


### Eigenanalysis

The asymptotic matrix properties (stage age distribution, population growth rate $\lambda$, and reproductive value) can also be calculated analytically using matrix math, instead of approximating these values by projecting an initial population vector out many time steps.

#### Annual population growth rate at SSD

The asymptotic annual growth rate or finite rate of increase is the dominant eigenvalue of the transition matrix.


```r
# Run the eigenanalysis
eigs.X <- eigen(X)

# Find the index position of the largest absolute value of the eigenvalues
dom.pos <- which.max(eigs.X[["values"]])

# Extract the dominant eigenvalue and retain only its real part
lambda <- Re(eigs.X[["values"]][dom.pos])
lambda
```

```
[1] 1.338048
```

<br>

#### Stable stage distribution

The stage stage distribution is associated with the right eigenvector $w_1$. The distribution is defined as:

$$
\frac{w_1}{\sum^{s}_{i=1}{w_1}}
$$
where $s$ is the number of stages.


```r
# Extract w, keeping just the real part, and divide it by its sum to get the stable stage distribution
w <- Re(eigs.X[["vectors"]][, dom.pos])
ssd <- w/sum(w)
round(ssd, 3)
```

```
[1] 0.981 0.017 0.002
```

<br>

#### Reproductive value

The reproductive value gives us one measure of the importance of an individual in each stage. Reproductive value is the expected contribution of each individual to present and future reproduction.

We can find each stage's reproductive value by solving for the dominant left
eigenvector $v$, where

$$
vA = \lambda v
$$

Since this vector $v$ is proportional to the reproductive values. We have the follow definition for reproductive value:

$$
\frac{v_1}{\sum^{s}_{i=1}{v_1}}
$$


```r
# Performing eigenanalysis on the transpose of the projection matrix
M <- eigen(t(X))

# Get the left eigenvalues and eigenvectors
v <- Re(M$vectors[, which.max(Re(M$values))])

# Extract just the dominant left eigenvector; we then scale it, so the stage 1 has a reproductive value of 1.0
RV <- v/v[1]
RV
```
