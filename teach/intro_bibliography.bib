	abstract = {Abstract: Inventory, monitoring, and experimental studies have been the primary approaches for documenting and understanding the problem of amphibian declines. However, little attention has been given to placing human-caused perturbations affecting one or more life-history stages in the context of the overall population dynamics of particular species. We used two types of ecological sensitivity analysis to determine which vital rates have the strongest influence on the population dynamics of western toads ( Bufo boreas), red-legged frogs ( Rana aurora), and common frogs ( Rana temporaria), pond-breeding amphibians that have declined in all or portions of their ranges. Our results suggest that post-metamorphic vital rates and highly variable vital rates both have a strong influence on the population dynamics of these species and therefore deserve more research and management attention. Ecological sensitivity analysis should be more widely applied to the issue of amphibian declines in order to identify the most plausible mechanisms of decline and prioritize which life-history stages should be the focus of research and management efforts. Future experimental studies of perturbations in one or more life-history stage should attempt to link the magnitude of the perturbation measured with the overall population-level consequences. Finally, current research, inventory, and monitoring efforts should be supplemented with demographic studies so that quantitative analyses can be applied to a wider range of species and life-history groups.},

	abstract = {Quantifying the impact of density, extrinsic climatic fluctuations, and demography on population fluctuations is a persistent challenge in ecology. We analyzed the effect of these processes on the irregular pattern of population crashes of Soay sheep on the St. Kilda archipelago, United Kingdom. Because the age and sex structure of the population fluctuates independently of population size, and because animals of different age and sex respond in different ways to density and weather, identical weather conditions can result in different dynamics in populations of equal size. In addition, the strength of density-dependent processes is a function of the distribution of weather events. Incorporating demographic heterogeneities into population models can influence dynamics and their response to climate change.},

	abstract = {Management strategies for invasive populations should be designed to maximise efficacy and efficiency, i.e. to accomplish their goals while operating with the least resource consumption. This optimisation is often difficult to achieve in stage-structured populations, because costs, benefits and feasibility of removing individuals may vary with stage. We use a spatially-explicit stage-structured model to assess efficacy of past, present and alternative control strategies for invasive guttural toads,
Sclerophrys gutturalis
, in Cape Town. The strategies involve removal of variable proportions of individuals at different life-history stages and spatial scales. We also quantify the time necessary to implement each strategy as a proxy of financial resources and we correct strategy outcomes by implementation of time to estimate efficiency. We found that the strategy initially pursued in Cape Town, which did not target any specific stage, was less efficient than the present strategy, which prioritises adult removal. The initial strategy was particularly inefficient because it did not reduce the population size despite allocating consistent resources to remove eggs and tadpoles. We also found that such removal might be detrimental when applied at high levels. This counter-intuitive outcome is due to the ‘hydra effect’: an undesired increase in population size caused by removing individuals before overcompensatory density dependence. Strategies that exclusively remove adults ensure much greater management efficiency than those that also remove eggs and tadpoles. Available management resources should rather be allocated to increase the proportion of adult guttural toads that are removed or the spatial extent at which this removal is pursued.},
