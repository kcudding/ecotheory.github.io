# Linear regression

### Introduction 

  A linear model is used when you want to test a prediction of correlation between an independent (or predictor) variable and a dependent (or response) variable (Phillips, 2018). For example, for our Hamilton Harbour data, we will be testing for a correlation between water level (our independent variable) and total zooplankton (our dependent variable) counted in the net grab. 

```{r include=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
soln=FALSE
#install.packages("readxl")
library("readxl")

# xlsx files
ham<- read_excel("ind dates flat all parameters Hamilton only FOR Kim.xlsx")
```

### Linear regression  using water level and total zooplankton

  In R, you can run a linear regression by using the lm() function. Your variables are entered in using the following formula.. 
  
  nameoflinearreg<-lm(dependent variable~independent variable, yourdata)

#### Try it now
```{r}
# removing NAs from the dataset 
na.omit(ham)
```

```{r}
# changing the column name to one that is easier to use
# (R does not like spaces in variable names)
colnames(ham)[colnames(ham) == 'water level'] <- 'waterlevel'

# running the linear regression of water level and total zooplankton
logwaterlzoo.lm<-lm((log(total.zoop))~(waterlevel), ham)

# getting the results using the summary() function
summary(logwaterlzoo.lm)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

```{r}
#Error in knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/fernsa/Downloads/R seminar -_ linear regression .png") :

### What does the summary output tell us about the relationship between water level and total zooplankton?
Talk amongst yourselves...

### What are the assumptions of a linear regression? 
  * There is a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variable (Statistics solutions, 2024).
  * The residuals are normally distributed (Statistics solutions, 2024). 
  * The variance of the residuals should be consistent across all the values of the independent variable (Statistics solutions, 2024). 
  * Each observation is independent of one another (there is no significant correlation between the independent variable values) (Statistics solutions, 2024). 

### How do you evaluate the assumptions of a linear regression?

  You can evaluate the assumptions of a linear regression by creating diagnostic plots. These look at the residuals of the linear regression, that were shown using the summary() function above, to determine if the linear model is appropriate for the data (the data does not violate any assumptions) (Statistics solutions, 2024). This will create 4 diagnostic plots: residuals versus leverage, scale-location, Q-Q residuals and residuals versus fitted values. 
  
```{r include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
#### Try it now
```{r}
# divide the window into a 2 by 2 grid
par(mfrow=c(2,2))

# plotting diagnostic plots with log transformed data
lab=c("a", "b", "c", "d")
for (i in 1:4){
plot(logwaterlzoo.lm, which=i)
mtext(text=lab[i], side=3, cex=2, adj=1)
}
```

#### a. 
The *residuals versus fitted plot* determines if the residuals exhibit non-linear behaviour (Statistics solutions, 2024). If the red line roughly follows the horizontal line on the plot, the residuals are showing linear behaviour (Statistics solutions, 2024). 

#### b. 
The *Q-Q plot* evaluates our second assumption; the residuals are normally distributed (Statistics solutions, 2024). If the points on the plot follow the diagonal line, then the residuals are normally distributed (Statistics solutions, 2024).  

#### c.
The *Scale-Location* plot is used to determine our third assumption; the variance of the residuals should be consistent across all the values The the independent variable (Statistics solutions, 2024). This is also called homoscedasticity (Bobbitt, 2021).

#### d.
The *Residuals versus Leverage* plot displays any influential points in the dataset compared to Cook's distance (Bobbitt, 2021). Ideally, the points should fall close to the '0' line on the plot with little variation. Any points that fall past the line indicating Cook's distance are considered strongly influential points (Bobbitt, 2021). 

### In the case of this linear regression between water level and total zooplankton, what do the diagnostic plots tell us? 
Talk amongst yourselves...

### How can we plot this linear regression? 
You can plot the data using the plot() function, superimpose the regression line using the abline() function, calculate confidence intervals using the predict() function and add them to the plot using the lines() function. 

#### Try it now

```{r}
hogwaterl<-(ham$waterlevel)

# taking the natural log of the response variable
logtotal.zoop<-log(ham$total.zoop)
logwaterlzoo.lm=lm(logtotal.zoop~hogwaterl)

# creating a vector 'x' to predict total.zoop from waterlevel
x <- seq(min(hogwaterl, na.rm=TRUE), max(hogwaterl, na.rm=TRUE), by = 0.05)

# calculate confidence intervals (confidence level 95%) for predicted total.zoop values
confidenceint<-predict(logwaterlzoo.lm, newdata=data.frame(hogwaterl=x), interval="confidence", level=0.95)
cf=as.data.frame(confidenceint)

# create a plot with water level and total zooplankton
# use xlab(), ylab() and main() to put titles on the plot
plot(x=ham$waterlevel, y=logtotal.zoop, xlab="Water level (m)", ylab="(log) Total zooplankton", main="Relationship between water level and total zooplankton")

# add regression line to the plot using the abline() function
abline(logwaterlzoo.lm, col="red")

# lower bound confidence interval
lines(x=x,cf$lwr, col="blue",lty=3 )

# upper bound confidence interval
lines(x=x,cf$upr, col="blue",lty=3 )
```

In this case, water level appears to have a positive correlation with total zooplankton. As the water level increases, the number of total zooplankton also increases. 

### Common mistakes 
  * Be careful when coding a linear regression using the lm() function that the independent and dependent variables are coded in the right order. i.e. lm(dependent variable~independent variable, data = yourdata).

### Alternative resource:

  Another way to evaluate the assumptions of a linear regression is to compare fitted values (theoretical values of the dependent variable that are predicted by the model, assuming linearity) and the observed values of the dependent variable in a plot (Phillips, 2018). If the model fitted values forms a diagonal line with the observed values of the dependent variable, then the linear model fits the data well, and the assumptions of the linear model are met (Phillips, 2018). See Phillips resource for more details and sample coding.
