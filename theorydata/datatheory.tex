mile!''``Have you used it much?'' I enquired.``It has never been spread
out, yet,'' said Mein Herr, ``the farmers objected: they said it would
cover the whole country, and shut out the sunlight! So we now use the
country itself, as its own map, and I assure you it does nearly as well.

\end{itemize}

Because these models arebased on causal mechanisms rather than
correla-tion, our confidence in extrapolating beyondknown data is
enhanced. Of course, there isalways uncertainty about how an
ecologicalprocess will interact with novel global changeconditions.

However, underconditions of global change, models based on thepast
behaviour of a system may not be suitablefor projection forward
(Williams et al.~2007,Lawler et al.~2010).

  is that true for generalist predators and specialists?
\item
  what about predators that eat prey competitors?
\item
\item
  what about predators that modify the environment?

Without mechanism, we can't answer these questions, and that's a
problem, since if we get the answer wrong, we might take an action that
has the opposite of the desired effect

  starting from \(\frac{dN}{dt}=f(N)-g(N,P)\) is no different than

\item
  mechanism requires an explanation or idea about the predators
  negatively impact net prey population growth rate (what is g(N, P)?)
\end{itemize}

-we can leave g(N,P) to be a mere description of phenomena, or we can
examine natural data closely, devise experiments, or reason logically to

  once the function is specificed, the model can also suggest expected

  fields), or to make guesses outside of this domain (true, but the
  interaction strength between these two species is really large
  compared to everything else)
\item
  one advantage tho, the model can include a variety of functional forms
  that pertain to different mechanisms\ldots{} we have to stop

\item
  these models have dubious explanatory value outside of the examplar
  classification system,
\item
  ``predator-prey'' model supposes there is a class of predator-prey
  interactions that have general properities accross species, systems
  and time that are related to the outcome of the interaction (-/+)
\item
  as I will discuss, the net effect of pairwise species interactions is
  not fixed.

\(\leftarrow\) this is the first reason I don't think this is a helpful
approaoch missing from machine learning approaches, their oversimplified
assumptions and extremely specific nature prohibit the universal
predictions achievable by machine learning.'' Baker et al.~(2018).
Mechanistic models versus machine learning, a fight worth fighting for
the biological community? Biology Letters, 14(5), 20170660.
\url{https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2017.0660}

Any attempt by machine learning technologies to predict individual
patient outcomes from past observations using a patient database is
potentially able to identify which of existing treatments is most
adequate, but intrinsically unable to suggest new treatment protocols or
to provide accurate predictions for new treatments. In the literature,
this aspect is referred as the `inductive capability' of the learning
algorithms (from past data, one can identify patterns happening in the
data). This is vastly different from the deductive capability of
mechanistic models, in which the combination of logical (mechanistic)
principles enables extrapolation to predictions about behaviours not
present in the original data {[}4{]}. In short, mechanistic models can
provide insights and understanding into the mechanistic functions of
treatments, and these are necessary to overcome the limitations of
machine learning predictions

I haven't seen an example of ``universal predictions achievable by
machine learning'' in ecology but I am certainly of the mind that both
approaches are useful IN THEIR DOMAIN OF APPLICATION

Environmental stochasticity or varia- tion in parameter values might
lead to amplification of disturbances {[}24{]} or differences in
expected dynamics. For example, varying parameter values in a
differential equation model can determine whether a monotonic or
oscillating approach to a stable equilibrium is expected (Box 1). There-
fore, uncertainty in parameter values will lead to uncertainty about
which dynamic behaviors are most likely.

\protect\hypertarget{acknowledgements}{}
We thank Luwen Chang and Matthew Zhou for their amazing learning curves,
and subsequent help coding up the modules. The eCampusOntario grant also
funded several students to evaluate an early version of the materials.
Lina Aragon Baquero, Lauren Banks, Madison Brook, Jacob Burbank, Nicole
Gauvreau and Aranksha Dilip Thakor provided valuable feedback.

The Git and GitHub module builds upon workshop materials that were
originally developed with Chris Grandin (DFO), who AME also thanks for
assistance with the module.

The Quantitative Biology in Life Science Graduate Programs workshop from
which this work arose which was supported by funding from the Burroughs
Wellcome Fund, from National Science Foundation Award DBI-1300426 for
NIMBioS, with additional support from the University of Tennessee. The
Workshop arose from a partnership between NIMBioS and the Southeast
Center for Mathematics and Biology (SCMB).

Support for the development of online training materials comes from the
Government of Ontario through a grant from eCampusOntario, and the
